# DevConnect

- A modern developer networking application to discover, connect, and collaborate with fellow developers.
- Connect with other developers, create/edit/delete profiles, send/accept connection requests, and manage your professional network.
- Permanent delete-account functionality that safely removes a user and all associated references across the network.

---

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Platform

- **Seamless user lifecycle:** Sign up, sign in, and sign out with sessions secured by **httpOnly JWT cookie (1‚Äëday expiry)**.
- **Full profile management:** Create, edit, and **permanently delete** profiles; delete-account cleans connections and pending requests to maintain DB consistency.

### Social & Networking

- **Connection flow:** Send, receive, accept, reject or cancel connection requests with clear incoming/outgoing states.
- **Connections feed:** Discover new developers in a fast, filtered home feed showing the latest profiles.

### Security & Compliance

- **Industry-standard auth:** Passwords hashed with **bcrypt**; authentication and authorization enforced with **JWT** tokens.
- **Cookie security & CORS:** `httpOnly` cookies and CORS configured to allow secure frontend-backend communication.

### UX & Performance

- **Responsive UI:** Built with utility-first styling for a clean mobile-first interface and accessible components.
- **Lightweight API layer:** Focus on fast Express endpoints and efficient Mongoose queries for quick discovery and profile updates.

### Developer-Focused

- **Extensible architecture:** Clear separation of controllers, routes, and models for quick feature additions (avatars, notifications, search).
- **API-first design:** Simple REST contract that‚Äôs easy to test (Postman) and integrate across platforms.

## üß∞ Tech Stack

This project combines pragmatic frontend tooling with a secure, scalable backend. Below is a concise description of each tech and why it was chosen.

### Frontend (Client)

- **React** ‚Äî Component-driven UI for fast iteration and reusable views.
- **Redux (RTK)** ‚Äî Predictable global state for auth, user data and request flows.
- **React Router** ‚Äî Declarative, nested routing for protected routes and clean navigation.
- **Axios** ‚Äî Promise-based HTTP client with `withCredentials` to send/receive cookies securely.
- **Tailwind CSS & DaisyUI** ‚Äî Utility-first styling with accessible, themeable components for rapid UI development and consistent visuals.

> The frontend code is available in the `frontend/` folder of this repo. (README focuses on usage & API; implementation files live in the repository.)

### Backend (Server)

- **Node.js + Express** ‚Äî Lightweight, performant server for REST APIs and middleware pipelines (auth, CORS, cookie parsing).
- **MongoDB + Mongoose** ‚Äî Flexible document DB that maps naturally to user profiles, connections, and request relationships.

**Key backend libraries & why they matter**

- **bcrypt** ‚Äî Securely hash and salt passwords before saving to the DB to prevent credential leaks.
- **cookie-parser** ‚Äî Parse and manage httpOnly cookies containing JWT tokens (secure session handling).
- **cors** ‚Äî Controlled cross-origin requests; configured with credentials to allow cookie-based auth from the frontend.
- **jsonwebtoken (JWT)** ‚Äî Stateless authentication tokens stored in secure cookies for session management (1-day expiry).
- **mongoose** ‚Äî Schema-driven ODM for data validation, relations (connections/requests) and concise DB queries.
- **validator** ‚Äî Validate email formats and other user inputs at the model level for data integrity.

### Recommended tooling & deployment notes

- **Development:** nodemon, dotenv for environment variables, and Postman for API testing.
- **Hosting:** Deploy backend to platforms like Render/Heroku/AWS Elastic Beanstalk; use MongoDB Atlas for managed DB.
- **CI/CD:** Add GitHub Actions for linting, tests, and automated deploys.

## üîí Security & Best Practices

- Store JWT in `httpOnly` cookies to reduce XSS risk; set `sameSite` and secure flags in production.
- Always hash passwords (bcrypt) and enforce minimal password complexity on the client side.
- Use server-side validation (validator + Mongoose schemas) to prevent malformed or malicious data.
- On account deletion, cascade cleanup of references (connections, incoming/outgoing requests) to avoid orphaned data.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

```bash
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/devconnect
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1d
COOKIE_NAME=token
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

---

## ‚úÖ How to Run

1. Start the backend (see `backend/` folder):

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env to set MONGO_URI and JWT_SECRET
npm run dev
```

2. Start the frontend (see `frontend/` folder):

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` to use the app.

## üõ†Ô∏è Extending DevConnect

- Add avatar uploads (Multer ‚Üí Cloudinary / S3).
- Introduce real-time notifications with Socket.io for requests/acceptances.
- Add search & filters (skills, location) and pagination on the feed.
- Add unit/integration tests for auth flows and API contracts.
